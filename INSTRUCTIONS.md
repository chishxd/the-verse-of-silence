# How to Play: The Verse of Silence

Welcome, Dissonant.

You have found a place where the echoes of a broken world still linger. This is not just a game, but a puzzle with a soul. Your choices here matter.

## Your Goal

Your goal is simple: clear the path guarded by the timid, magical creature known as the **Glimmerkin**. How you choose to do this, however, will change everything.

## The Steps of Weaving

The entire game is played with your mouse through a simple drag-and-drop interface.

### 1. Observe the Creature
Look at the **Glimmerkin** at the top of the screen. Read its description carefully. It contains the secret to a peaceful resolution. This is the **puzzle** you have been given.

### 2. Know Your Echoes
Your **Inventory** on the right holds the raw magical echoes you can perceive. These are your tools, your ink, your musical notes. You begin with five fundamental echoes.

### 3. Weave a Spell
This is a two-step process:
*   **First, drag an Echo** from your Inventory and drop it onto the large **Crafting Altar** in the middle. The Altar's hint text will change, showing you what you've placed.
*   **Then, drag a *second* Echo** from your Inventory and drop it onto the same Altar. The two echoes will combine.

### 4. Witness the Outcome (on the Altar)
*   If the echoes are compatible, the Altar will inform you that you have **successfully woven a new spell**. This new spell will immediately appear in your Inventory.
*   If the echoes repel each other, the Altar will tell you that the **combination is not possible**. It will then reset, ready for you to try again.

### 5. Unleash Your Creation
Once you have a new spell in your Inventory, you can use it. **Drag your created spell** from the Inventory and drop it directly onto the **Glimmerkin** at the top of the screen.

This will end the encounter and reveal the consequences of your actions.

## The Two Paths: The Core of the Game

This is not a game with one solution. It is a test of character.

#### üìú The Path of Wisdom (The Merciful Path)
This is the path of the scholar, the puzzle-solver. By carefully reading the Glimmerkin's description and thinking about the nature of your echoes, you can deduce the combination for a **non-lethal** spell. This path proves your intellect and empathy.

#### ‚öîÔ∏è The Path of Power (The Forceful Path)
This is the path of the warrior, the one who makes their own solution. The game gives you no clues for this path. You must go out of your way to intuit how to weaponize the neutral echoes around you. This path is a demonstration of your strength and your will.

Which path will you take first? Can you discover both?

Now go. The Verse awaits your song.
