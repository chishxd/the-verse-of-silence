## The Concept

In a world where true magic has been silenced, its song shattered in a cataclysmic act of sacrifice, you are one of the few who can still perceive the faint melody of what was lost. The ruling Order calls you a heretic, a Dissonant, for seeking the forbidden knowledge of the First Warden, Elara Verse-Sunder—the woman who broke the world to save it.

Your quest is to follow her echoes, uncover the truth of the Great Binding, and decide the future of a world living in a beautiful, tragic silence.

## Gameplay

This project presents the "First Trial," a single-room puzzle that serves as a proof-of-concept for the core mechanics. Your goal is to overcome the ancient Guardian that blocks your path.

*   **Observe:** The Guardian is not a monster, but a living puzzle. Study its description to understand its vulnerabilities.
*   **Combine:** Drag the faint echoes of the sundered First Verse from your inventory onto the crafting altar to combine them.
*   **Create:** Weave these echoes into new, unstable spells—the forgotten notes of a lost song.
*   **Choose:** Your choices have consequences. You can solve the puzzle with a clever, non-lethal spell that respects the Guardian's legacy, or you can use brute force to shatter it. The path you take will determine the outcome.

## Tech Stack

The game engine and interface were built with a focus on modern, lightweight web technologies.

*   **Framework:** SvelteKit
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
*   **Build Tool:** Vite
*   **Core Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript
