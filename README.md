**Siege Hackathon Week 6 - Theme: "Magic"**

</div>

## The Concept

In a world where magic is a broken song, its power silenced by a catastrophic act of sacrifice, you are a Dissonant‚Äîone of the few who can still hear the faint, lingering echoes of what was lost. Your mission is to uncover the truth behind the First Warden, Elara Verse-Sunder, and her final, desperate gambit.

**The Verse of Silence** is a narrative puzzle game that puts you at the heart of this mystery. Presented with a single, ancient creature‚Äîa living puzzle‚Äîyou must gather the faint echoes of the sundered First Verse from your inventory and weave them into new, powerful spells. The core of the game is not just _what_ you create, but _why_.

This project is a single-level, proof-of-concept game engine built in 6 days for the Siege Hackathon.

## The Two Paths

Every puzzle has multiple solutions, and every choice has a consequence that ripples through the lore.

- **The Path of Wisdom (Merciful):** By observing your environment and understanding the creature's nature, you can weave a non-lethal spell. This is the path of intellect and empathy, proving you are worthy of the Verse's harmony.
- **The Path of Power (Forceful):** You can ignore the puzzle and instead choose to weave a weapon. This path is a seductive promise of strength, but it leads to a darker, more discordant form of magic.

## How to Play

1.  **Observe** the Glimmerkin to understand its nature and its weaknesses.
2.  **Drag** two Echoes from your inventory on the right onto the Crafting Altar on the left.
3.  If the combination is valid, a **new spell** will be woven and added to your inventory.
4.  **Drag** your new spell from the inventory and drop it onto the Glimmerkin to see the outcome.
5.  **Play again** to discover a different path!

## Post-Hackathon Backlog

This project was built as a scalable foundation. Future ideas include:

- A full multi-level story mode following the lore of Elara Verse-Sunder.
- A "Genocide Route" where repeated acts of cruelty unlock the dark "Verse of Power."
- Rival Dissonants and the "Pillars of Dissonance" as boss battles.
- Dynamic UI theming based on the colors of the background art.
